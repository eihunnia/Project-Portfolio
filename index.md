# Welcome to My Portfolio

This site showcases my final-year Computer Science project, including demos, code samples, and a breakdown of the technical challenges I solved.  
I built this project as part of my third-year degree, focusing on creating a robust and well-engineered system while developing industry-relevant skills.

## 🎮 Third-Year Project Overview

My project is a **[insert project type here: game system, AI simulation, tool, engine module, etc.]** designed to:

- Demonstrate strong software engineering principles  
- Showcase practical applications of what I have learned in my degree  
- Provide a clean, maintainable codebase  
- Explore real-world development practices

You can find the full repository here:

## 🧠 Key Technical Features

### Architecture & Design  
- Modular structure using clean design patterns  
- Encapsulated components for extensibility  
- Clear separation of logic and presentation

### Algorithmic / AI (If used)  
- Pathfinding  
- State machines  
- Behavioural logic  
- Resource simulation

### Implementation  
- Built in **C++ / C# / Python / Java** (replace with actual language)  
- Runs efficiently with well-structured update loops  
- Includes in-engine debugging / logging tools

### Tooling  
- In-project visualisation tools  
- Editor utilities  
- Automated or semi-automated workflows

## 💻 Code Example

```cpp
// Example snippet — replace with code from your project
void UpdateEntity(Entity& entity) {
    for (auto& component : entity.components) {
        component->Update();
    }
}
